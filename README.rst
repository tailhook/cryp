Cryp Password Manager
---------------------

Cryp is written with simplicity in mind. It has no fields for all kinds of
accounts and so forth. It has a comment and password fields, which both
encrypted.

Cryp also has a simple gui and a command-line interface. With latter mostly
used for backups and similar tasks.
